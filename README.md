# Hi, I'm Tara Olivia Bjørheim! 👋

### Front-End Developer | Aspiring UI/UX Designer

I'm a passionate **front-end developer** originally from Stavanger, Norway. I’ve lived in many places, including Costa Rica, Tanzania, and under the northern lights in Bodø. Currently, I’m based in Brussels, Belgium, where I work as an **administrative coordinator** and continue expanding my web development skills.

## About Me 🌟

I love building **responsive**, **accessible** websites with a focus on **user experience**. I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies like **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, and my goal is to create web applications that look great and provide seamless, intuitive experiences for users.

I’m especially drawn to **UI/UX design** and love finding creative ways to create interesting designs and improve user interactions on the web.

## Projects 🌱

Here are some of my favorite projects that showcase my work:
